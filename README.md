# CityGML-Utility-Network-ADE
This repository contains the datasets and codes used for my MSc. Thesis research on the development of a 3D standard data model for below and above ground utility network features.

In short, the files in this repository are used to conduct the following two steps (in FME):
- Creating CityGML Utility Network ADE data (with ESRI Shapefiles as input)
- Putting the data in a 3D City Database

The database will be enriched with above as well as below ground (utility network) data.
